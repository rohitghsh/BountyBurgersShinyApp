# BountyBurgersShinyApp

Burger Bounty is a gourmet meatless burger restaurant that operates a food truck through several cities
in the Hartford area. 

The goal of this project is to develop a DSS to help Burger Bounty improve food truck sales and operations.
Even though the food truckâ€™s menu consists of a variety of different main dishes and sides, the DSS will
concentrate on six different types of burgers with the following names:
1. Bounty Hunter Burger
2. Classic Cheeseburger
3. Spicy Mutiny Burger
4. Nature Bounty Burger
5. BEC Burger (veggie bacon, egg, and cheese)
6. Double Veggie Burger


The burgers vary in the recipe used to make the patty, number of patties, condiments, weight, etc. The
truck operates at locations in one of these seven towns: Downtown Hartford, East Hartford, West
Hartford, Manchester, New Britain, Glastonbury, and Wethersfield. Assume that the truck only visits at
most one town every day.

We would like to better assess what location to visit in each day by using some of the factors in the dataset. 
We believe that there are certain factors that have a strong effect on sales, such as weather, day of the week, 
burger prices, the location, etc. To do so, we would like to enhance the DSS to provide location recommendations 
based on location data and predicted burger revenues.

Here is a Shiny app to provide location recommendations to visit the shop.
